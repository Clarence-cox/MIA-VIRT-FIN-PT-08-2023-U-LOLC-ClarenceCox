## Overview and Origin

* What is the name of the company? Plaid Inc. 

* When was the company incorporated? It was founded in 2013 in San Francisco, California.

* Who are the founders of the company? Zach Perret and William Hockey

* How did the idea for the company (or project) come about? Zach and William met in Atlanta at Blain & Co's offices. The two sought to build a consumer-facing financial planning app after receiving a lack of transparency for bills they paid. 

* How is the company funded? How much funding have they received? 21 investors fund Plaid and have raised $734.3M in funding over seven rounds. 


## Business Activities

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve? Plaid is trying to help people connect their financial accounts to apps and services to help them provide tailored services to these individuals. These apps and services are meant to help individuals manage their money and make progress toward financial goals. 

* Who is the company's intended customer? Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? Plaid's intended customers are businesses wishing to facilitate connection to their website. For example, certain corporations like Coinbase use Plaids services to facilitate connecting one's bank account to fund their portfolios. 

* What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?) Plaid offers institutions a way of streamlining operations and cutting costs by reducing costs and improving customer satisfaction rates. Competitors cannot integrate such seamless connections, giving Plaid Inc. a competitive advantage. 

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company's engineering blog or use sites like StackShare to find this information.) They use secure cloud infrastructure technologies to enable people to connect accounts quickly and safely. They implement these technologies through the use of APIs. APIs are application programming interfaces where two computer programs communicate with each other, hence why Plaid Inc. can provide such swift and seamless connectivity between applications. 


## Landscape

* What domain of the financial industry is the company in? They fall into the financial services domain by building a data transfer network that powers FinTech and digital finance products. 

* What have been the major trends and innovations of this domain over the last 5–10 years? The financial services industry has undergone tremendous changes over the last five years, with the recent Covid-19 pandemic. These include the implementation of software-based protocols to facilitate digital payments and connecting financial accounts to particular applications. These software-based changes have reduced costs tremendously and have helped large corporations cut costs. The financial services sector is continuously changing and will continue to do so over the coming years as technology advances. 

* What are the other major companies in this domain? The top three competitors are Adobe with 61.34%, Microsoft Azure with 14.66%, and Jira Software with 4.93% market share. Plaid currently has a market share of 0.37%. 


## Results

* What has been the business impact of this company so far? Plaid Inc. has had a substantial business impact since its founding in 2013. Although the company initially faced some setbacks, it has emerged as a top contender for seamlessly coupling accounts and fighting fraud. The company currently has a $13.4 billion valuation and serves over 4,000 companies, including Fortune 500 companies and popular startups- more than ten times as many since it started. By creating a single platform to create this seamless integration, Plaid has a bright future ahead and will continue to impact the FinTech sector significantly. 

* What are some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success? How is your company performing, based on these metrics? Companies within this sector use valuation, customer satisfaction, and the number of customers to track success. Since its foundation, Plaid has grown tremendously. It is emerging as a popular one-step protocol within the finance industry to create a stress-free way of coupling financial accounts to applications. Some companies using Plaid Inc. services include Coinbase, Venmo, and Robinhood. 

* How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same domain? Plaid Inc. faced many setbacks when it first began but has been on a steady upward trend since they have streamlined its platform to perform at its best. Many prominent players within this sector are still creating competition, but they are driving factors for Plaid Inc. to grow and create the ultimate platform. They have done well for themselves as a relatively new player and continue to grow. After all, upward trends appeal to investors, and Plaid can manage backlash and push for their services to someday take up a larger market share than they currently have. 


## Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!) Based on my research, Plaid Inc. should aim to create a fraudulent auto-detector for digital wallets interacting with breached smart contracts and essentially create a way of auditing these smart contracts and creating a safer, more fun world for everyone. Their fraud prevention targeting should be embedded within the code and be used in multiple facets of the company not solely at the digital wallet level, but for every company. 

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company? This service would benefit Plaid Inc. as it would provide a new way for users to interact with their product. It would also boost safety within the financial sector, something drastically needed with the increase of fraudulent deep fake technologies. Providing this service would not only create an extra layer for individuals to protect themselves but also bring overarching security to the industry and create a competitive advantage for Plaid over current competitors. 

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize? This would require a web developer to create the necessary technology for Plaid to audit the applications or websites individuals are using. Another technology is to create an Artificial Intelligence that does the audits and creates a two-factor authentication system within Plaid Inc. and its services. 

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution? These technologies are appropriate as they would create a secondary level of security and provide a general-purpose protective protocol to their advantage. Overall, deploying these tools would create an extra layer of security and play a key role in developing a competitive advantage over its competitors.
